India, officially the Republic of India 
(ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[21] is a country in South Asia. 

It is the seventh-largest country by area; 
the most populous country as of June 2023;[22][23] and fr
om the time of its independence in 1947, the world's mos
t populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabi
an Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land bo

rders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Ban
gladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of 
Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border 
with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000
\ years ago.[27][28][29] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation 
as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human 
genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins 
of 
the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation
 of the third millennium BCE.[31] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European
  language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[32][33] Its evidence today is
   found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely 
   vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian 
   languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35] By


   400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36]
    and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.
    [37] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires
     based in the Ganges Basin.[38] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging 

     creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and the 
     incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][41] I
     n South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious 
     cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]

In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became esta
blished on India's southern and western coasts.[43] Muslim armies from Central Asia int
ermittently overran India's northern plains,[44] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate,
 and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45] In the

 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in 
 south India.[46] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[4

 7] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48] leaving a
  legacy of luminous architecture.[l][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British East In
  dia Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its 
  sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were g
  ranted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of 
  education and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist mo

  vement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in e
  nding British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two 
  independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-m
  ajority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented mig
  ration.[
